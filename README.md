# Dynamics3-Lecture

This is the material for a lecture I gave, with title "From multiple degree-of-freedom to distributed systems: linear strings and sound synthesis". The repository contains:

- the Jupyter notebook with the slides,
- a PDF version of the slides,
- a folder with images and videos.

You can also find two Matlab codes with very basic sound synthesis algorithms applied to the multiple degree-of-freedom systems. One uses the modal method, the other uses a finite difference approach.

You can view the slides online with [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/format/slides/github/atorin/Dynamics3-Lecture/blob/master/Dynamics_Lecture_Slides.ipynb). An extended version, with additional text and explanation, can be found [here](http://blog.albertotorin.it/blog/mdof-systems/) and [here](http://blog.albertotorin.it/blog/mdof-sound-synthesis/).
